# Prob-Stat---Project-Spring-2020-
This is the repository for Math 310 - Probability &amp; Statistics (Spring 2020) Final Project.

Task 3:
The angles choosen at the moment are continuous rather than discrete and step size is discrete. Task 5 requires step size and angle to be continuous. Changes need to be made accordingly.
I don't understand re-etry model. Maybe the node isn't leaving the circle because I've taken continuous angle rather than discrete. Idk will look into that tomorrow.
Also once task 3 is done, task 5 and 7 can easily be done.
