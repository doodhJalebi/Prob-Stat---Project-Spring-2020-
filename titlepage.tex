\section*{Task 1}
\subsection*{Simulation Model:}
In order to determine a good average distance from starting position for each step number, the simulation was run
100 times, each one being 1000 steps long. Refer to figure 1.

\subsection*{Mathematical Model:}
\begin{align*}
    y_{t+1} \approx y_{t} + X
\end{align*}

where X is a discrete random variable that takes on discrete values $[-1, 1]$ with probabilites $[0.5, 0.5]$ respectively.
$y_t$ is the distance from the starting point at time $t$. $y_{t+1}$ is the distance from the starting point at time $t+1$.


\section*{Task 2}
\subsection*{Simulation Model:}
In order to determine a good average number of steps for a fixed starting distance between the two persons, the simulation was run
100 times, each one being 1000 steps long, for each value of starting distance $x$. Refer to figure 2.

\subsection*{Mathematical Model:}
\begin{align*}
    E[T] = \frac{1}{2}(\text{time for person A to reach }\frac{d}{2})\text{ for even d}\\
    E[T] = \frac{1}{2}(\text{time for person A to reach }\frac{d+1}{2})\text{ for odd d}\\
\end{align*}

where T is a random variable that denotes the time taken in number of steps for person A and B to meet.
$d$ is the distance between them at time $t = 0$.


\section*{Task 3}
\subsection*{Simulation Model:}
The simulation was run first for a single random walk and then for 100 random walks in order to observe the differences and randomness in the walks. The simulation with the nodes having an equal probability to move in discrete values for angles and step size. No pattern could be observed from this. However, when running the simulation with unequal probabilities for angles and step size, a pattern could be found in which all random walks were simulated close to each other, at the angle having the highest probability.

\subsection*{Re-entry Model:}


\section*{Task 4}
\subsection*{Simulation Model:}
This builds on Task 1's simulation model with the only difference being that the step size is modeled by a uniform random variable now.
Refer to figure 4.

\subsection*{Mathematical Model:}
\begin{align*}
    y_{t+1} \approx y_{t} + X
\end{align*}

where X is a continuous random variable that takes on values $[0, 1]$ with unifrom probabilites.
$y_t$ is the distance from the starting point at time $t$. $y_{t+1}$ is the distance from the starting point at time $t+1$.
